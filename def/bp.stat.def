/* These ".stat" files contain the various statistics that can be taken via STAT_EVENTs.
   It's not a good idea to reorder these, since many calls are made like
   STAT_EVENT(ICACHE_MISS + hit) which could update either.  All stats are printed both
   as 'Interval' and 'Cumulative'.  'Interval' is measured during the current stat
   interval, 'Cumulative' is over the entire run so far.

   DEF_STAT( Name, Type, Ratio )

   The 'Type' column is used to group statistics together and format the printouts
   somewhat.  See the 'RATIO' type for a description of the 'Ratio Stat' column.
   Possible 'Type' values are:

	COUNT -- The count is what's important.  Just print the number of times it
	occurred.  
	
	PER_CYCLE -- We care about how many times this occured per cycle, so divide by
	the number of cycles.  (Ex. IPC)  The count is also printed.

	PER_INST -- Same thing, but per instruction.

	DIST -- This is a little bit complicated.  The first DIST type encountered
	signals the beginning of a distribution.  The next DIST encountered marks the
	end of the distribution (inclusive).  All of the stats in-between should be of
	type COUNT.  All of the stats in a distribution are printed as a percentage of
	the total.

	RATIO -- This stat should be printed as a ratio.  The 'Ratio' argument
	determines which other stat should be used.  The current stat is divided by that
	specified in the 'Ratio Stat' column.  This column is ignored for all types but
	RATIO.
