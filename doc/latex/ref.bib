% \hspace{\parindent}
% Agarwal~\cite{aga89} found that for multiprogramming workloads, the miss
% rate for virtually-addressed caches is higher than the miss rate for
% physically-addressed caches.  Different programs use different (physical)
% frames of memory.  If the cache is physically addressed, programs tend not
% to compete for the same cache sets.  On the other hand, the layout of the
% virtual address space does not vary significantly between programs.
% Different programs usually use the same (logical) pages of memory.  If the
% cache is virtually addressed, the programs will compete for the same cache
% sets, creating ``hot-spots'' in the cache.  Agarwal showed that these hot-%
% spots could be reduced by indexing a virtually-addressed cache with a hash
% of the virtual address and the process identifier (PID).

% Cache conflict misses may be the result of the operating system doing a poor
% job of assigning (logical) pages to (physical) frames of memory.  The Cache
% Miss Lookaside (CML) Buffer~\cite{ber:lee94} counts the number of misses that
% occur to each frame of memory.  When the number of misses for a frame exceeds
% a threshold, the CML Buffer sends an interrupt to the processor.  When the
% processor acknowledges the interrupt, it examines the CML Buffer to determine
% which frames had large numbers of misses.  Frames that potentially compete
% for the same cache sets and that had large numbers of misses are identified.
% The pages associated with these frames are then reassigned such that further
% conflicts are avoided.

% \hspace{\parindent}
% The predictive sequential associative cache~\cite{cal:gru96} is a two-way
% set associative cache with a least recently used (LRU) replacement policy
% that has the same RAM bank organization and access time as a direct-mapped
% cache.  Unlike conventional two-way set associative caches, in which both
% cache lines of a set are accessed in parallel, the predictive sequential
% associative cache only accesses one cache line at a time.  A predictor
% guesses which of the two cache line will contain the requested data.  The
% predicted line is probed first.  If the line contains the requested data,
% the data is retrieved.  Otherwise, the line's rehash bit, which was first
% used for column-associative caches~\cite{aga:pud93}, indicates whether the
% data might be found in the other cache line.  If the data might be found
% in the other line, the other line is probed.

% Victim caches~\cite{jou90} are small fully associative caches that are used in
% conjunction with a direct mapped cache to reduce the number of conflict misses.
% When a miss occurs in the direct mapped cache, the victim cache is probed for
% the data.  If the data is found in the victim cache, the contents of the direct
% mapped cache line and the victim cache line are swapped.  If the data is not
% found in the victim cache, the data is fetched from the next level of the memory
% hierarchy and written into the direct mapped cache.  First, however, the line
% in the direct mapped cache that will be replaced is copied to the victim cache.

% \hspace{\parindent}
% McFarling~\cite{mcf91} introduced a technique called dynamic exclusion that
% reduces the number of misses for direct-mapped caches.  The technique uses
% small finite state machines to record the access patterns to cache lines. 
% This information is used to control the replacement of cache lines.  Cache
% lines that have been accessed many times are harder to replace than cache
% lines that have only been accessed a few times.  This information is also
% used to anticipate which cache lines will be used once, and then immediately
% replaced by another cache line.  Storing such lines in the cache hurts
% performance, because it replaces cache lines that might be used again with
% cache lines that will never be used again.  These cache lines are dynamically
% excluded from the cache; that is, they are passed through the cache without
% being stored.

% Topic: Enlarged basic blocks, dynamic scheduling
% Examines dynamic scheduling, speculative execution, and basic block
% enlargement.  Ran experiments in which the issue size, window size,
% memory speed, and branch prediction were varied.  Main conclusions:
%
%  - the larger the issue width, the larger the range in performance
%    for the different configurations.
%  - the higher performance machines were less affected by memory
%    latencies.
%  - adding extra memory ops to instruction word really improves
%    performance.
%
% What were latencies of floating point ops?  None of the benchmarks
% seemed to have any floating point ops.  Is this a safe assumption
% for applications of the future?
%
% Branch prediction was done with two bit counter.  What was 
% prediction correctness rate?  How much improvement would Tse-Yu's
% work bring?
% 
% The enlarged blocks were formed from looking at most frequently
% taken branches.  Is this the best way to do it?  No branch fault
% prediction is done.  Need to think about this.
