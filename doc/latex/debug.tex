To check the correctness of the module, We provide debugging features
with text-based debugging messages. For example,

\begin{Verbatim}
debug message example
\end{Verbatim}

You can define anywhere. Opt version will nullify these statement for
performance purpose.

enable variable

To enable debug messages \Verb+make dbg+ and 

\begin{Verbatim}
debug_cycle_start
debug_cycle_end
\end{Verbatim}

debug macros are defined in \Verb+src/debug_macros.h+

debug macro is very similar to \Verb+printf+ function.

\begin{Verbatim}
_debug(debug_variable, const char * format, ... )
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}
#define DEBUG(args...) _DEBUG(*m_simBase->m_knobs->KNOB_DEBUG_MEM, ## args)
\end{Verbatim}


useful data for 

\begin{Verbatim}
core id
thread id
uop num
inst num
vaddr
req_id
\end{Verbatim}


To add a new debug stage, you need to add a debug knob variable in debug.param.def


%\begin{Verbatim}
%DEBUG(
