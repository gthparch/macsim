Please use Pin 3.13  (version number 56759) for the current trace generator 

How to generate x86 traces
  1. do make (copy libzlib.a in the location )
 (optional)
  1. Simpoint - Mostly we use SimPoint (PinPoint). Follow instruction
     in $PINHOME/source/tools/PinPoints

  2. Otherwise - Fix trace generator module based on your needs. Then,
     pin -t trace_generator.so -- $BIN $ARGS

     [1] Install Pin  (https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html) 
     [2] go to macsim/tools/x86_trace_generator directory 
     [3] export PIN_ROOT and PIN_HOME as the root directory of your pin install and copy libzlib.a 
          into $PIN_ROOT/intel64/lib/ and $PIN_ROOT/extras/xed-intel64/lib
     [4] make 
     [5] pin -t obj-intel64/trace_generator.so - $BIN $ARGS 



Note

  1. As the pin version changes, we need to consider few things.
     Ideally, everything should be okay, but sometime there are
     changes in the xed files (especially opcode or instruction
     category). In this case, we need to update few fields in the
     pintool as well as the simulator.

     1) Sanity check will be failed if there are changes.

     2) The compilation might be failed as well.

     Once fixing pintool, also some simulator logic needs to be modified.

     Simulator
       trace_read.h : 

         1) enum TR_OPCODE_ENUM

       trace_read.cc :
     
         1) init_pin_convert
         2) g_tr_reg_name
         3) g_tr_opcode_names
     

Known Problems

  1. pin-2.10-41150-gcc.3.4.6-ia32_intel64-linux/pin: line 52: pin-2.10-41150-gcc.3.4.6-ia32_intel64-linux/ia32/bin/pinbin: No such file or directory 
 
     This happens due to missing ia32 libraries. Please install ia32-libs.   
     
     => apt-get install ia32-libs

Changes

  1. November 2011 

    Register compression logic is replace by REG_FullRegName, which
    translate partial register to full register.
